# Python Animation

Welcome to the **Python Animation** project! This project showcases various animations created using Python's graphical libraries, providing a fun way to visualize and understand how animations can be implemented programmatically.

## Features

- **Multiple Animations**: The project includes different types of animations, demonstrating various animation techniques.
- **Interactive and Fun**: Provides a visually engaging way to learn Python animation techniques.
- **Simple Codebase**: The code is straightforward and well-commented, making it easy for beginners to understand.

## Demo

A demonstration of the animations can be run locally after following the installation steps below.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aditikute24/python-animation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd python-animation
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install any necessary libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *If `requirements.txt` is not available, you might need to manually install the libraries mentioned in the script (e.g., `turtle`, `pygame`, `matplotlib`, etc.)*.

4. **Run the animation script**:
   ```bash
   python animation.py
   ```

## Usage

- Open the terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the desired animation script using Python.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the animations.
- **Turtle**: A Python library for creating simple graphics and animations.
- **Pygame**: A library designed for writing video games, also useful for creating animations.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots.
